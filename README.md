# hello-world
My First Repository!
My name is Fred Meraz and I am a Human man. I take care of a lot of pets and keep them in good health. I love music, Formula 1, video games, and biking, not necessarily in that order. I am excited to potentially develop a career in data science, and GitHub (and R) seems like an extremely useful tool for that and in general.
